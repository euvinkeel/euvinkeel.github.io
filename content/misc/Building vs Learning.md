* waxing philosophical
* more theory, may be revised

* intro
	* reflecting on past projects
	* reflecting on cowboy code
	* frustratingly shallow knowledge of a lot of things
	* frustratingly close to zero knowledge of a lot more things
	* i've always been more motivated by an end product
	* i'm more of an artist-creator than one who stays deep in the weeds of things

* building:
	* high breadth required to hook stuff together
	* complex
	* using a variety of tools in your toolbox, only one kind of use-case from each tool
		* can only use one aspect from the swiss army knife
	* orchestrate a ton of things, each one has many different aspects to them
	* can get super messy if you're a generalist without deep, idiomatic knowledge to implement things in a more polished, more sophisticated, more competent way
	* tools have to interact with eachother for you to learn how to use two things together and that may be suboptimal
	* at the end you may have a "working" product, though shoddily made

* learning:
	* focused
	* getting really good with a specific tool in your toolbox
		* discover better uses of it, **more** uses, may find it more versatile
		* get really good with your swiss army knife
	* exploring multiple aspects of some framework/library
	* each facet of a library is useful for different use cases
	* like multiple simple "hello world" examples, but *disjointed*
	* not that useful for building sufficiently complex things
	* more of an *investment* you make for the future
	* you can now envision **more ways** to combine/integrate it with other tools
	* you may not have much to show, but it could prove very useful later; **that is, if the future version doesn't come and blow all your knowledge out the water/made redundant**

* how to deal with this conundrum
* choose what to deeply learn wisely:
	* **fundamentals that don't change** versus **rapidly changing libraries/stacks**
		* maybe on a spectrum
* need a goal to motivate the learning in the first place - what's the goal, what's the means
* need to devote time to learning if you want a **good** product
