My last project was mostly a front-end only web-app that cloned the Tango game from LinkedIn.

I thought about what my next project could be for a long while. I've been grinding on MathAcademy for most of this week, trying to regain the math knowledge I lost over the years. I'm still pretty stuck job searching, and my only income comes from two roblox games that I've published ever since graduating. So I thought about another project I could add to my portfolio.

Honestly, I can't get this game idea out of my head, and I'd like to make something that actually gets regular users again. It's a rewarding challenge to grow a game with all the skills gamedev requires: planning, programming, architecting, UI/UX designing, visual graphics, marketing, community outreach... It's just a more social way of developing things.

And with [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com), I can actually try to improve my TypeScript knowledge while publishing my development process under my real, public persona. Hopefully I'll become less walled in by the Roblox ecosystem as a result, although they really are doing the heavy work of hosting, deploying, marketing (via algorithm). Perhaps I could add my own website or backend for more web development experience.

Because this is under my real persona, it'll be like starting from scratch. [I made a group/community here](https://www.roblox.com/communities/35626415/EUKEE#!/about). Let's see where I can take this from a brand new account and a brand new group.

We will see where this goes!
