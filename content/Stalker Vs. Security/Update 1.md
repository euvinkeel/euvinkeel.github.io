Going into this, I *know* that I want to use the following:
* [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com) 
* [JECS](https://ukendio.github.io/jecs/)

Still undecided on other libraries or frameworks.
roblox-ts is pretty straightforward: I just need more TypeScript practice.
I chose JECS because the last few games I made used the [matter](https://matter-ecs.github.io/matter/) library (which I loved using), and JECS aims to be magnitudes faster in performance.

I'm going to spend most of today trying to familiarize myself with the basics and fundamentals of JECS.
