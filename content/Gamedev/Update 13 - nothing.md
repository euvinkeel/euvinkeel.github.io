Some unexpected emergency happened and it just sapped my energy to create or make anything while dealing with it.

lately bene playing balatro
all the games i've made and were successful were never thought up in a lab or out of thin air, me hypothesizing what might be fun or profitable. instead, it's always been made out of frustration with current games and me saying "i could make a better one". then i just go ahead and do it.
but it's not just frustration, it's also some love for the games i find or play
because there's a redeemable seed of an idea there that i really want to bring out into reality. and honestly money doesn't really factor that much into the design, it's all about making the stuff *i* want to have exist, and it's just a side consequence that i have to be the one to do it.
balatro is a great game, and i feel a sense of what makes games fun again. the variety of gameplay styles kind of forced on you, for you to have to take what you can get, literally accept the cards you're dealt with, and try to make a run from that.
in other words i like randomized runs with systemic gameplay
