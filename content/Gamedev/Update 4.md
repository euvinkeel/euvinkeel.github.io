Mostly spent the last few days setting all these framework libraries up.

I'm kind of losing myself into these really neat tools being developed. I currently have [JECS](https://ukendio.github.io/jecs/), [Jabby](https://alicesaidhi.github.io/jabby/), and [Planck](https://yetanotherclown.github.io/planck/) running here (links if you don't know what I just typed):

Something really cool that this debugger offers out of the box is the ability to see anyone's local state as an admin. I can see each system's performance as they run on someone else's device and query/edit their own ECS state all from my admin panels.

When I get something flashy working, I'll tweet more.
