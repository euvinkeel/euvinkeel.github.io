Mostly spent the last few days setting all these framework libraries up and wrangling with TypeScript, learning how to work with third party library typings.

I'm kind of losing myself into these really neat tools being developed. I currently have [JECS](https://ukendio.github.io/jecs/), [Jabby](https://alicesaidhi.github.io/jabby/), and [Planck](https://yetanotherclown.github.io/planck/) running here (links if you don't know what I just typed):

Something really cool that this debugger offers out of the box is the ability to see anyone's local state as an admin. I can see each system's performance as they run on someone else's device and query/edit their own ECS state all from my admin panels.

When I get something flashy working, I'll probably tweet more. Most of this is all setup.


Reminds me back when I was learning an older ECS framework for roblox, a predecessor to JECS. A lot of learning new libraries just for the sake of learning new shiny libraries. Maybe that was a huge chunk of why I took so long to make games.

I do wonder how fast I could be if I could just stop working around re-learning new libraries and other people's code and just develop all of my own hacky solutions until I have my own unique workflow and framework to use across a ton of small games with copious reuse of assets.

They might look similar to eachother, but I don't think roblox users would care. And I don't think I would, either. It seems like doing the above would drastically lower activation energy and speed, allowing me to pump out as many interesting ideas as I can.
