* how to best learn things at depth? can i?
	* am i able to do mini projects and explorations to count as "having learned it"? deep bottemless holes of things to discover?


* make it really easy to collaborate on a tiny animation sketch (maybe like 10 seconds at most), 24 fps max

* possibly monetizable for longer duration animations or resolutions
