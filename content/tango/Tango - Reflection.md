# tl;dr
* Learning fast comes before building fast.

# Inspiration
It began how most of my projects start: I notice a pain point, no matter how trivial, and begin to think about how I could solve it.

When I first set out to make this, I really just needed a push to code something again. It had been a while since I sat down and tried to complete a full project, so I thought that recreating one of my favorite morning routines (playing LinkedIn's games) would be a simple, quick way to get back into creating things.

More importantly, the only [other site](https://tangogame.org) that offers an infinite-mode had some issues with it. At the time, changing the puzzles sometimes resulted in tiles not responding to clicks, I had to refresh the page sometimes, the board was too visually different from the original, and it wasn't actually infinite (there are 100 pre-set boards).


I had forgotten what it was like to be a beginner in another environment, with different conventions, conceptions, and libraries. Now I understand that for any given platform, moving fast with good execution is only possible when you know a select few tools really well -- with all of their kinks and flaws -- to sprint past all the bugs, docs, and tutorials.


Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it runs and looks. There are optimizations to be made: notably, the backtracking algorithm used to generate random boards & the way each individual rive instance loads. There could be more features, like open sourcing the TangoTS module, making it *actually* modular and portable, high scores, ELO rankings...






All of that ignored how deep each one of those topics can get.


* not actully a problem for buildilng stuff
* you cna make a suboptimal project and get results
* stop worrying about premature optimzation
* 



# What I need

* tutorials vs real-usage
* overambition ignores the fact that:
	* libraries aren't documented perfectly
	* abundance of choices of potential tools
	* debugging and stalling takes energy away from building features

# Redirection




*Learning* fast is a prerequisite to *building* fast, and they require different priorities.

# Learning versus building

This project showed me that I must be more intentional with what I do: am I learning, or building?

That seems like an odd statement, because it's said that learning and building can go hand in hand in the sense that coding along with tutorials is way more effective than just reading them, or that real-world practice is required to develop a skill.


On one end of a spectrum, you have the "tutorial" stages: toy projects and "hello world" examples that *should* work perfectly.


On the other end, you run into all the bugs and open (yet ghosted) GitHub issues reported for unexpected and undocumented behavior -- the things the documentation *doesn't* answer.


I don't mean "building" in the sense of building a todo app from a framework's "Getting Started" page.


When I build a project, I do so to satisfy some worldly problem or itch of mine. It could be a game I've never seen anyone else get right, 



projects:
* breadth first
* shallow usage
* inefficient usage
* reliance on LLMs to fill in the blanks
* not good for deep learning the more complex your project is

goal of learnings
* to make stuff
* to make *good* stuff
* to make stuff *faster*, update your brain's cache to execute quickly

goal of projects
* to showcase your skill level
* to effect change and value to the world (as opposed to tutorial projects, trivial apps)

# Learnings

This project forced me to dive right in to new tools.
Rive, for all the struggles I had with it, is still really attractive to me for creating animated graphics and putting that polish & shine on things. As someone with experience with DaVinci Resolve and Blender, I really appreciate a proper visual editor for animated graphics. I also found myself reaching for tailwind for really quick styling iteration, and the v4 release has been such a nice step away from wrangling config files. The more I use these, the faster I can make stuff happen.

But now, I'd like to be more intentional with my learning. I want to make something more interesting, more useful. I want to contribute to communities so they can use what I build.


* draft points
	* motivation for learning a new project or doing a trivial project
	* mention to community learn out loud
	
	* learning web libraries/frameworks for making new projects
		* and how i feel about them
	
	* what about my career?
		* transferrable skills?
		* popular library?
		* low level coding, math, ml, academic stuff?
		* what does the industry want?
		
	* **what do i want?** **what do i value?**
	* next steps, reflections, breaks?
	* project ideas? moving quick, fast
	* community ideas? contributing to others?
	
	* community learn out loud - thankfulness, gratefulness





There were a lot of diminishing returns I was seeing. Frankly, I'm not sure
