TART: Topological Active Recall Trainer

been using MathAcademy and Anki a lot lately. I wish Anki natively had topologically sorted cards so basic cards get presented before advanced cards do, and advanced cards can count towards some "recall score" toward the prerequisite cards.

Essentially, I wish there was a MathAcademy for everything. It could be art or geography or some science.
