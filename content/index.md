# About
I am:
* a UCSD computer science graduate currently self-learning AI/ML
* an artist who uses [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com), and [HEAVYPAINT](https://heavypaint.com) to digitally design, sketch, illustrate, paint, and animate frame-by-frame ([DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) is great for video editing too)
	* (mainly doing illustration and hand-drawn animation! think sakuga)
* a creator who will learn any tool to get the job done

This is where I write what I'm learning about.
